# Stochastic Volatility in Physics: Technical Research Summary

## Technical Summary

- Development and analysis of stochastic volatility models for physical systems using stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and Fokker-Planck equations.
- Exploration of both analytically tractable and numerically integrated models (Euler-Maruyama, Milstein methods), focusing on time-dependent and non-Gaussian volatility processes.
- Extensive Monte Carlo simulations and empirical validation with real-world datasets from statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics.
- Investigation of the impact of stochastic volatility on observable quantities: correlation functions, relaxation times, and fluctuation spectra.
- Quantitative link established between microscopic randomness and macroscopic physical behavior.
- **Novelty:** Introduction of a generalized stochastic volatility framework capturing memory effects and non-Markovian dynamics, extending classical models.
- Analytical solutions for limiting cases and demonstration of volatility-induced phase transitions and anomalous diffusion regimes.
- Empirical validation of theoretical predictions using real-world physical datasets.
