# M2R Research Project: Intestinal Stem Cell Fate and Single-Cell Analysis

## Technical Summary

- Comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic dissection of the intestinal crypt-villus axis using high-throughput scRNA-seq.
- Data preprocessing, normalization, and dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP) performed with Seurat and Scanpy.
- Unsupervised clustering and cell-type annotation based on canonical marker genes.
- Reconstruction of differentiation trajectories and lineage hierarchies using Monocle, Slingshot, and RNA velocity analysis.
- Gene regulatory network inference (SCENIC) and pathway enrichment analyses to elucidate transcriptional programs and signaling cascades (Wnt, Notch, BMP).
- **Novelty:** Dynamic modeling of cell-cell interactions across pseudotime using ligand-receptor inference (CellPhoneDB, NicheNet), revealing temporally resolved niche-stem cell crosstalk.
- High-resolution mapping of Lgr5+ stem cell differentiation and identification of intermediate progenitor states.
- Discovery of transcriptional regulators and signaling pathways driving fate bifurcations and plasticity.
- Mechanistic insights into regulation of intestinal epithelial renewal in both homeostasis and injury.
